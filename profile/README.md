🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

Zesty’s mission is to grow the economy of the spatial internet, which means:

1. Enabling creators to make a living by building for the spatial internet, and,
2. Onboarding businesses so they can provide additional products and services to our ecosystem.

Today, we make these things possible with a monetization solution.
