## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Zesty’s mission is to grow the economy of the spatial web, which means:

1. Enabling new and existing creators to make a living by building for the spatial web, whether these are spatial apps or content.
2. Onboarding businesses to the spatial web to provide products and services to users already in the ecosystem.

Today, we make these things possible with our monetization solution, which is already enabling a few passionate game developers using our Zesty SDK to make enough money to pay rent every month.
