**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

We're on a mission to make it easier to build and run a business in the metaverse. Today, we make this possible with our monetization solution, which is already enabling a few passionate game developers using our Zesty SDK to make enough money to pay rent every month. We are currently exploring ways in which more users of XR headsets can turn their hardware into devices they can use to grow revenue for their businesses.

If what we're doing is of interest to you, please get in touch with us by emailing us at elijah@zesty.xyz

Our docs are here: https://docs.zesty.market
